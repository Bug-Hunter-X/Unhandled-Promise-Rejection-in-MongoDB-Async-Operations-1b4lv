# Unhandled Promise Rejection in MongoDB Async Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous MongoDB operations using Node.js and the official MongoDB driver.  The `bug.js` file showcases an example where a promise rejection isn't properly handled, potentially leading to silent failures. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## Problem
Asynchronous operations in JavaScript, particularly within promises, require careful error handling.  If a promise in a MongoDB operation rejects (due to an error like a network issue or invalid query), and the rejection isn't caught, it can result in the process continuing to run without indication of the failure.

## Solution
The solution involves using `.catch()` to handle potential rejections, providing better error logging and preventing unexpected behavior.  Additionally, it's best practice to handle errors within the `finally` block to ensure cleanup (closing database connection) occurs regardless of success or failure.
